# Blix â€” [Demo](https://voormann.github.io/blix)
Simple particle system built in Canvas 2D that's easy to use and customize. The main focus was performance with batch rendering, minimal color state changes with a predefined palette, object pooling with separate pools for the explosions and particles, efficient sorting and simplifying the particles' shape as they get smaller.


### Basic setup
1. The particle system is initialized by calling `particles.init()`.
2. Your tick/render loop needs to include:
```js
explosions.update();
particles.draw();
```
3. Explosions can be spawned by using:
```js
const explosion = explosions.create();
explosion.init(/* X position */, /* Y position */);
```


### Customization
The basic settings can be changed in the explosion object:
```js
const explosion = {
    multiplier: 8,
    variations: 6,
    colors: ['#6434E9', '#2C7CE5', '#49CC5C', '#F8C421', '#FB6640', '#F82553']
};
```
`variations` corresponds to how many color indices there are in the array, and `multiplier` decides how many particles spawn per color index (e.g. 8 * 6 = 48).

How the particles behave can be changed in the Particle class' init function:
```js
init(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    const direction = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
    const velocity = Math.random() * 3.5;
    this.vx = Math.cos(direction) * velocity;
    this.vy = Math.sin(direction) * velocity;
    this.wither = Math.random() * 0.007 + 0.007;
    this.radius = 2 + Math.random() * 4;
    this.dead = false;
}
```
`direction` shapes the explosion. `velocity`/`radius` gives the particles their speed and initial radius. `wither` sets the constant rate at how fast the particles' `radius` decreases.
